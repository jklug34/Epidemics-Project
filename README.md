# Epidemics-Project
Historical analysis of the rates of seven infectious diseases by U.S. state and year using datasets from Kaggle (Project Tycho : Contagious Diseases)

  -Smallpox, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis A, and whooping cough (pertussis)
  
  -From the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) reports for the United States ranging from 1916-2011
  
  
  - The states of New York, California, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin had the largest cumulative average number of contagious diseases, driven in large part by the measles dataset

  -When normalizing for state population Vermont, Wisconsin, Montana, Utah and Wyoming had the highest average incidence of all contagious diseases
